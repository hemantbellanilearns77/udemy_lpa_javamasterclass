# Java Masterclass Practice — Tim Buchalka Course

This repository is a personal practice workspace maintained by **Hemant Bellani**, a senior AEM engineer and former Solution Architect with over 14 years of experience delivering Adobe Experience Manager solutions.

## 🎯 Purpose

While my core expertise lies in enterprise-scale AEM solutions, I am currently deepening my command of **core and advanced Java** through structured hands-on exercises. This work supports both my long-term interest in Java development and my upcoming **Oracle Java SE 11 Developer Certification (1Z0-819)**.

The code here is largely based on the "Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers" by Tim Buchalka on Udemy, with custom enhancements and organization to align with my learning goals.

## 🛠 Work in Progress

This is a **live practice repository**. Expect gradual refinements, structural reorganizations, and topic-specific enhancements over time. I follow a strict logging and archival policy for all auto-generated reports and tooling scripts used (e.g., PMD, Checkstyle, Sonar).

## 🔒 Repo Status

This repo was previously private and is now public to:
- Keep track of my progress
- Share learning methods
- Showcase consistency in Java skill-building beyond AEM

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

- Ensure you have **Java 11** or newer installed
- Open any folder in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or compile via CLI:  
  ```bash
  javac SomeFile.java
  java SomeFile
  ```
- Some folders (e.g., `IO_NIO`, `Concurrency`) may have dependencies on standard Java libraries or package structures. Adjust classpaths as needed.

## 📅 Study Focus

I dedicate ~30 hours/week (Mon–Fri) on this learning path, balancing Java practice with certification prep.
